# docker-php-web-app-debug-demo

This repo holds a very simple PHP app in a Docker image that is used in a blog post where I talk about how to debug PHP
apps that are running inside a Docker container.

The blog post can be found [here](http://joenyland.github.io/blog/debug-a-php-app-in-a-docker-container-using-xdebug/).

An image for this app can be pulled from the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/joenyland/php-web-app-debug-demo/).
