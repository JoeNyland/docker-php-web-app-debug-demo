# php-webapp-debug-demo-docker

This repo holds a very simple PHP app in a Docker image that is used in a blog post where I talk about how to debug PHP
apps that are running inside a Docker container.
  
The blog post can be found [here](http://joenyland.me/blog/debug-a-php-app-in-a-docker-container-using-xdebug/).
